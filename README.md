# Algorithmic study of weightwise almost perfectly balanced functions and their properties

To load all the functions open sage (SageMath version 9.5) and load the main.sage file

> load("main.sage")

The repository contains basic functions to study the properties of WAPB anf WPB functions, and the contrbitions provided in the following papers
